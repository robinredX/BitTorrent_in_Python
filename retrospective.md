# Retrospection

## Difficulties

To some extent, we faced difficulties in managing client-server communication with player.py and also in handling messages from hub.py. There was some gap in communication with metagroup with respect to testing.

## Lessons learnt

Possibly one take away from this project is to have a better architecture in place before initiating project. We did comptemplate on that and though we are quite satisfied with our architecture, this is something that could have been smoother.

## What would we like to keep for the next time?

For our future work, we'd love to keep our code architecture, and also the lessons we learnt from the project.

## What would we do differently?

Group communication is something that could have been improved. Even though it was no way near bad, there is certainly a room for improvement. Also, we may try to implement a more efficient way to manage connections with respect to download/upload speed.
