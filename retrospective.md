# Retrospection

## Difficulties

To some extent, we faced difficulties in managing client-server communication with player.py and also in handling messages from hub.py and in implementing advanced features of our proposed protocol such as the strategy to choke client. There was some gap in communication with team members and metagroup as well, but to a very less extent.

## Lessons learnt

Possibly one take away from this project is to have a ready code architecture in place before initiating project. We did comptemplate on that and though we are quite satisfied with our architecture, this is something that could have been smoother.

## What we'd like to keep for the next time

For our future work, we'd love to keep our code architecture, and also the lessons we learnt from the project. This is something we are proud of.

# What would we do differently?

Perhaps group communication is something that could have been improved. Even though it was no way near bad, there is certainly a room for improvement.
