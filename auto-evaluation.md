# Auto Evaluation

## Status of the project

Our client works in its full capacity and no part of the code, as per our testing, is our of order. The client is able to download and upload books (and thus stuff) as expected.

## Comparison of results with our initial objectives

In the start of the project, we wanted to build a bittorrent client based on the protocol we agreed upon. During the project, we did encounter some challenges about some aspects of implementation of our prolocol e.g. book management, downloading preference and choking. Those issues were managed efficiently. In the end, we believe, we have fulfilled the objectives we set earlier. 

## Good Development Practices

* **Documentation**: (Self-score: 20/20) <br/><br/>
In the project repository, the documentation of Auto-evaluation and README are provided in markdown (.md). We checked whether these documentations are displayed well and rectified any formatting error.

* **Git**: (Self-score: 19/20) <br/><br/>
The group members used English for all their commit messages. During git commits, the members provided informative messages about their respective commits. During the development, members pushed and were not fearful in making changes.

* **Code**: (Self-score: 18/20) <br/><br/> 
Every part of the code in this project is written in English. To format code properly, group members used different tools: Laetitia used Pycharm, Notepad++, Mohamed Nasar used Pycharm and Robin used Spyder. We were careful not to mix tabs and spaces during writing codes. Further, in codes, we believe that we have used very self-explanatory names and followed a good code architecture.

* **Tests**: (Self-score: 18/20) <br/><br/>
We thoroughly tested our code. We had regular group meetings to discuss and test each other's codes and provided feedbacks. When something didn't work, we tried to find what was the problem and notified the other person. A regular document about testing was manintained during the course of project. We tested messages - both encoding and decoding, and whether the players were communicating as we planned. Issues were rectified in timely and efficient manner. We also communicated messages from our client to client of our meta-group and to test whether or not the messages are accurately received and decoded by their client.
